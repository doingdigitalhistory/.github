# README for HST251: Doing Digital History - Rapid Development Challenge
This organizational repository is the landing page for Dr. Gillian Macdonald's HST 251: Doing Digital History class for Fall semester 2025. The repository contains a rapid development activity. It was designed for a college digital history course, but it has applications across a variety of humanities and data-oriented courses. The goal is for students to think about developing digital projects from a machine perspective (being able to build without so much hard "coding" exprience) and from the humanistic perspective (interrogating how our data shapes interpretation). Feel free to adapt and circulate! 

## The Activity
I wanted students to think critically about artificial intelligence, its limitations and potential for the field of digital history. 

For this challenge you’re going to assign a few roles in your groups including:
- **Researcher** - who reads primary sources and writes notes
- **Writer** - writes the interpretive material for the project site. Makes an argument about what the sources tell you about the topic.  
- **Developer** - works with the ai to make your project, you will need to refine it a few times. 
- **Editor** - creates a README + puts all the work together in a doc and sends it to Gillian.
For this project you will need to make an argument about 4 sources and what they tell you about a one of these options:
1. Indian Removal (docs found at [National Archives site](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/jacksons-message-to-congress-on-indian-removal) and [Library of Congress](https://guides.loc.gov/indian-removal-act/digital-collections))
2. Mark Twain Letters (docs found on [Mark Twain Project](https://www.marktwainproject.org/letters/uccl/))
3. Slave Ads (docs found at [Freedom On the Move](freedomonthemove.org))
